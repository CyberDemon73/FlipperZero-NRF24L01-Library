# NRF24L01+ Library for Flipper Zero

A lightweight C library for interfacing with NRF24L01+ 2.4GHz RF transceivers on the Flipper Zero platform.

## Overview

This library provides a simple API for communicating with NRF24L01+ modules through the Flipper Zero's external SPI bus. It handles initialization, configuration, and basic transmit/receive functionality.

## Features

- Hardware SPI communication with NRF24L01+ modules
- Easy initialization and configuration
- Support for both standard and no-acknowledgment transmission modes
- Transmit and receive mode switching
- Power level control
- Channel selection

## Hardware Connections

The library is configured for the following pin connections:

- **CE Pin**: External Port Pin PA6
- **CSN Pin**: External Port Pin PC3
- **SPI Bus**: Flipper Zero External SPI Bus

## API Reference

### Initialization and Setup

```c
bool nrf24_init(NRF24* nrf24);
```
Initializes the NRF24L01+ module and verifies communication. Returns `true` if successful.

```c
void nrf24_deinit(NRF24* nrf24);
```
Puts the module in idle mode and releases hardware resources.

```c
bool nrf24_check_connection(void);
```
Verifies that the module is responding correctly. Returns `true` if connected.

### Configuration

```c
void nrf24_set_channel(uint8_t channel);
```
Sets the RF channel (frequency). Valid range: 0-125, corresponding to 2.400-2.525 GHz.

```c
void nrf24_set_power(uint8_t power);
```
Sets the RF output power level:
- 0: -18dBm
- 1: -12dBm
- 2: -6dBm
- 3: 0dBm (maximum)

### Mode Control

```c
void nrf24_set_tx_mode(void);
```
Configures the module for transmission mode.

```c
void nrf24_set_rx_mode(void);
```
Configures the module for reception mode.

```c
void nrf24_set_idle(void);
```
Puts the module in power-down (idle) state to conserve power.

### Data Transmission

```c
void nrf24_write_payload(uint8_t* data, uint8_t length);
```
Sends a data payload with auto-acknowledgment (if enabled). Maximum length: 32 bytes.

```c
void nrf24_write_payload_noack(uint8_t* data, uint8_t length);
```
Sends a data payload without waiting for acknowledgment. Maximum length: 32 bytes.

### Low-Level Functions

```c
uint8_t nrf24_read_register(uint8_t reg);
void nrf24_write_register(uint8_t reg, uint8_t value);
```
Read or write to the module's registers directly.

```c
void nrf24_flush_rx(void);
```
Flushes the receive FIFO buffer.

```c
void nrf24_spi_acquire(void);
void nrf24_spi_release(void);
```
Acquire or release the SPI bus for transaction sequences.

## Example Usage

```c
// Initialize module
NRF24 nrf24;
if (!nrf24_init(&nrf24)) {
    // Handle initialization error
    return;
}

// Configure module
nrf24_spi_acquire();
nrf24_set_channel(76);  // Set to channel 76 (2.476 GHz)
nrf24_set_power(3);     // Set to maximum power
nrf24_set_tx_mode();    // Set to transmit mode
nrf24_spi_release();

// Send data
uint8_t data[] = {0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04};
nrf24_spi_acquire();
nrf24_write_payload(data, 4);
nrf24_spi_release();

// Clean up when done
nrf24_deinit(&nrf24);
```

## Implementation Notes

- The library assumes the NRF24L01+ is connected to the Flipper Zero's external SPI bus.
- SPI bus must be acquired before performing operations and released afterward.
- The module's connection is verified by checking if the SETUP_AW register returns the expected value (0x03).
- Transmission is triggered by pulsing the CE pin high for 15Î¼s after loading the payload.

## Dependencies

- Flipper Zero Firmware
- `furi.h` and `furi_hal.h` libraries
